    "# Type conversions\n",
    "\n",
    "In the lecture, we discussed the basic built-in data types: integers, floating-point numbers, booleans, and strings. Python allows us to convert one type to another using the following functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [`int()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int) converts its argument to an integer.\n",
    "- [`float()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#float) converts its argument to a floating-point number. \n",
    "- [`bool()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool) converts its argument to a boolean.\n",
    "- [`str()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str) converts its argument to a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "These conversions mostly work in an intuitive fashion, with some exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Define a string variable `s` with the value `'1.1'`. Convert this variable to integer, float, and boolean.\n",
    "2.  Define the string variables `s1`, `s2`, and `s3` with values `'True'`, `'False'`, and `''` (empty string), respectively. Convert each of these to boolean. Can you guess the conversion rule?\n",
    "3.  Define a floating-point variable `x` with the value `0.9`. Convert this variable to integer, boolean, and string.\n",
    "4.  Define the integer variables `i1` and `i2` with values `0` and `2`, respectively. Convert each of these variables to boolean.\n",
    "5.   Define the boolean variables `b1` and `b2` with values `True` and `False`, respectively. Convert each of them to integer.\n",
    "6.  NumPy arrays cannot be converted using `int()`, `float()`, etc. Instead, we have to use the \n",
    "    method [`astype()`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.astype.html) \n",
    "    and pass the desired data type (e.g., `int`, `float`, `bool`) as an argument.\n",
    "    Create a NumPy array called `arr` with elements `[0.0, 0.5, 1.0]` and convert it to integer\n",
    "    and boolean type.\n"

    "# Working with strings\n",
    "\n",
    "Strings in Python are full-fledged objects, i.e., they contain both the character data as well as additional functionality implemented via functions or so-called _methods_.\n",
    "The official [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods) \n",
    "provides a comprehensive list of these methods. For our purposes, the most important are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [`str.lower()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.lower) \n",
    "    and \n",
    "  [`str.upper()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.upper)\n",
    "  convert the string to lower or upper case, respectively.\n",
    "- [`str.strip()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.strip) \n",
    "  removes any leading or trailing whitespace characters from a string.\n",
    "- [`str.count()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.count)\n",
    "  returns the number of occurrences of a substring within a string.\n",
    "- [`str.startswith()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.startswith) \n",
    "    and \n",
    "  [`str.endswith()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.endswith) \n",
    "  check whether a string starts or ends with a given substring.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, strings are also sequences, and as such support indexing in the \n",
    "same way as lists or tuples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a string variable with the value \n",
    "```python\n",
    "s = '  NHH Norwegian School of Economics  '\n",
    "```\n",
    "and perform the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Strip and surrounding spaces from the string using `strip()`.\n",
    "2. Count the number of `'H'` in the string.\n",
    "3. Modify your code so that it is case-insensitive, i.e., both instances of \n",
    "   `'h'` and `'H'` are counted.\n",
    "4. Reverse the string, i.e., the last character should come first, and so on.\n",
    "5. Create a new string which contains every 2nd letter from the original.\n",
    "6. Select the last character from this new string using at least two different methods.\n"
