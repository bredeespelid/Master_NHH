    "# CRRA utility function\n",

    "The CRRA utility function (constant relative risk aversion) is the most widely used utility function in macroeconomics and finance. It is defined as \n",

    "$$\n",
    "where $c$ is consumption and $\\gamma$ is the (constant) risk-aversion parameter.\n",

    "1. You want to evaluate the utility at $c = 2$ for various levels of $\\gamma$. \n",
    "    1. Define a list `gammas` with the values 0.5, 1, and 2.\n",
    "    2. Loop over all elements in `gammas` and evaluate the corresponding utility. Use an `if` statement to correctly handle the two cases from the above formula.\n",
