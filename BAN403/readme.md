## Course Description

**BAN403 â€“ Simulation of Business Processes** is a graduate-level course at NHH that introduces simulation as a tool for analyzing complex business systems under uncertainty. The course focuses on two core simulation techniques:

- **Monte Carlo simulation** for modeling randomness and risk.
- **Discrete Event Simulation (DES)** for process-oriented systems over time.

Students learn how to build and analyze simulation models using **JaamSim**, **Python**, and **Excel**. Applications include resource planning, bottleneck analysis, risk evaluation, and decision support across domains like logistics, banking, healthcare, and service operations.
